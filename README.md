Hi,

I am the author of the book titled Integrated Circuit Design - IC Design Flow and Project-Based Learning. I encourage you to make the most of the resources and documents associated with the textbook, which can greatly enhance your understanding and application of the content.

You are welcome to use and share the following materials in your teaching, learning, or professional activities:

Verilog designs for experiments, labs, and projects presented in the book.
1) Appendices A-C, which contain tutorials on the recommended project directory, Vim Editor, Siemens ModelSim, AMD Vivado, and other valuable commands and scripts for IC design projects.
2) These resources are designed to provide deeper insights and practical applications of the concepts covered in the book.

Instructors teaching IC design-related courses are encouraged to reach out with your information (affiliation, title, and email) to request the following additional resources:
1) Lecture slides covering all chapters.
2) Extensive teaching suggestions for two courses: "Introduction to IC Design Flow" and "Advanced Digital System Design."
3) Verilog design and simulation materials for experiments, labs, and projects outlined in the book.
4) A thorough solution manual for exercises/assignments.
5) Two examination tests to facilitate course assessment.

If you find any particular sections of the textbook especially useful or if there are any documents you would like to see expanded upon or newly created, I would appreciate your feedback. Your input is invaluable in helping to continuously improve and update the resources available.

Please feel free to distribute these documents among your colleagues, students, or peers, with proper attribution to the textbook. My goal is to facilitate a broader exchange of knowledge and to support the educational and professional growth of everyone who uses this book.
